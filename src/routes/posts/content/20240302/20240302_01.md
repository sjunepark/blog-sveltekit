> This is a comprehensive guide on how to persist blog posts in a sveltekit app

The most intuitive way to store blog posts is to use markdown files, within the file system of the sveltekit app.

| Pros | Easy to use | Easy to use | Easy to use |

## Requirements

- Use SvelteKit
- Be able to render `svelte` components directly within the markdown files to show intere
    - To show interactive examples
- Consider performance

## Options

### 1. Using external storage(ex. AWS S3)

- Is inappropriate since the markdown files need to be rendered by the server in order to embed `svelte` components

### 2.use `mdsvex` and store `.md` files within the deployment

<summary>üí≠ Won't there be inefficiency since the browser will get all the blog posts at once?</summary>
    - üí° Solution
        - No. The blog posts will be served as [dynamic routes](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing). This means that the browser will only get the relevant posts which it requested. SSR will be used to render the post on the server side.

- `mdsvex` enables the use of svelte components within `.md`(or whatever extension you prefer) files.
  > ‚ö†Ô∏è **Problem**
  > - Webstorm doesn't give syntax highlighting and throws warning for `script` tags
      >    ```plaintext
      <script lang="ts">
      import Example from './Example.svelte';
      </script>

```
  > üí° **Solution** 
    1. **Use the [mdx plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14944-mdx) by JetBrains**
       - This enables use of `script` tags within `.mdx` files
       - ‚ö†Ô∏è Problem
         - Webstorm has much better support for `.md` files
         - It's not possible to make webstorm recognize `.mdx` files as `.md` files
         - 
### With deployment

## What file format should I use for blog posts?

### Considerations

- I want to be able to render svelte components within the post in order to create interactive sections.

### Options

- Using plain svelte components
- Using markdown
- How do I render svelte components within markdown?
